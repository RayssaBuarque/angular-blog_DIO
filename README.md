# Angular Blog (DIO 2023)
My first Angular based Project.

This Personal Blog was developed based off this [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/18089191-Blog-Layout) layout inspiration.

>Side Project made during my participation in [DIO's Angular BootCamp powered by iFood](https://web.dio.me/track/potencia-tech-angular-developer-powered-ifood).

## Setup and Documentations

This project was made with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.2 and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs) version 18.16.0.

I mainly used the documentation in the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page for reference during development.
